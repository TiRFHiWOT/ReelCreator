# Mobile Landing Page - Two Visual Concepts

## Overview

Build two production-ready, mobile-first landing page concepts targeting girls aged 19-22 who create Reels/TikTok content. Both will use the same structure and Russian copy provided by the client, but with different visual styles.

## Structure

- **Concept 1**: Minimalist/Neutral - clean typography, subtle colors, ample whitespace
- **Concept 2**: TikTok-style/Feminine - vibrant colors, playful elements, trendy aesthetics

## Implementation Details

### File Structure

- `concept1-minimalist.html` - First visual concept
- `concept2-tiktok.html` - Second visual concept
- Each file will be self-contained with embedded CSS (or separate CSS files if preferred)

### Technical Approach

- Mobile-first responsive design (one-column layout)
- Clean, semantic HTML5
- Modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid for layout)
- No JavaScript dependencies
- Fast loading, production-ready code
- Proper typography hierarchy and spacing

### Design Principles

- **Concept 1 (Minimalist)**:
- Neutral color palette (grays, whites, subtle accents)
- Clean sans-serif typography
- Generous whitespace
- Subtle shadows/borders
- Professional, understated aesthetic

- **Concept 2 (TikTok-style)**:
- Vibrant, feminine color palette (pinks, purples, gradients)
- Playful typography (mix of fonts)
- Rounded corners, soft shadows
- Gradient backgrounds
- Trendy, energetic aesthetic

### Content Blocks

Will implement with dummy English content for now. Typical structure includes:

- Hero section
- Features/benefits
- Social proof/testimonials
- Call-to-action
- Footer

**Note**: Russian copy and finalized structure will be provided later and can be easily swapped in.

## Next Steps

1. Create Concept 1 (minimalist) HTML/CSS with dummy English content
2. Create Concept 2 (TikTok-style) HTML/CSS with dummy English content
3. Ensure both are fully responsive and production-ready
4. Structure code to easily swap in Russian copy later
